# Principal-Component-Analysis-on-The-Boston-Housing-Dataset
Introduction The purpose of this post is to explain Principal Component Analysis in a detailed and simplified way. Iâ€™ll cover the working of PCA step by step, so everyone can understand it and make use of this technique. What is PCA? Principal component analysis is fundamentally a dimensionality reduction algorithm, but it can also be useful as a tool for visualization, noise filtering, feature extraction, and engineering, and much more. PCA is the process of computing the principal components and using them to perform a change of basis on the data, sometimes using only the first few principal components and ignoring the rest.
